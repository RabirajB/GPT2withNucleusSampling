      ", when I was about ten years old. I was on a trip to the Himalayas, and there was a huge fire in the middle of the river, so I went to the coast and went into a huge, huge fire. And it just went on and on, and I was like, \"Oh my God, this is going to be so big, this is going to be so big, this is going to be such a huge fire.\" And then I was sitting in a hotel in Geneva, and I was like, \"Oh my God, I'm going to land again.\" And I kept thinking, \"Why didn't I stay there?\" I saw a fire that had burned down in one of the hotels. And then it was just like, \"Oh my God, I'm going to be back in that hotel, I'm going to be back in that hotel.\" And that's when I realize, here's the kind of life I could have lived without flying, if I had just wanted to do what I wanted to do, and I wanted to be a life-planer with a set of skills that would allow me to find adventure and not just go to another world and go see what's out there.\n",

I'm not a daydreamer, like, \"Well, I'm going to do something a little different, I'm going to go out there and do something.\" But I'm a person who's been there, done that. And I've had adventures, but I've been in places that were not my life, like in the mountains, and I've been in places where I didn't even know what I was doing. And then I got to the point where I realized, \"Okay, what would I do?\" And that's what I do. Because I've been on adventures, I've been on adventures, I've been in places where I didn't even know what I was doing. And I've been on adventures that I have no idea what I'm doing. And I'm a fantastic person.\n",
